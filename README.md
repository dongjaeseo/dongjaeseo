Research Intern (Jul 2025 – Dec 2025) at the AIoT Lab, Seoul National University. (Prof. Hyung-sin Kim)  
Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Engineering Design from IIT Madras. (Prof. Ganapathy Krishnamurthi) 

I work on machine learning for clinical data, focusing on representation learning for medical imaging and long physiological time series. 
At the AIoT Lab, I studied sleep stage modeling to understand representation quality and temporal context in foundation models.
